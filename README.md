COMP 562 Final Project: Fake or Real News Detection


Because of the abundancy of information with various qualities available nowadays, we are interested in whether machine learning algorithms can classify fake news versus real news.

Data used in the project comes from https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset.

The following algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine
- Bi-directional LSTM 

are used to classify fake versus real news.
